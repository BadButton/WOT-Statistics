		<h2>Welcome to WOT Statistics 2.5.0.9!</h2>
		
		<h3>KNOWN ISSUES</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong><font color="#800000">Overall WN7 and WN8 have minor calculation glitches</font></strong>, working on it - no need to report them
			<li>No WN8 Values for new introduced tanks. I'm waiting for official numbers from the WN-Team. <strong>This results in WN8 of 0 and 145.</strong> See also <a target="_blank" href="http://www.vbaddict.net/content/121-WN8-0-and-145-Values">this Post</a>.
			<li><strong>Count of Battles </strong>sometimes not 100% correct
			<li>.NET Framework on the first start with unexpected character '#'? This is an issue with an outdated dossier converter. Delete the content of this folder: c:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\WOT Statistics\python
