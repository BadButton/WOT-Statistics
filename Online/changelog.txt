WOT Statistics 2.5

This is the first release after NSaaiman gave this projects in my Hands.

As a beta release, bugs can and will occur. Please focus in this beta on the rewritten mechanics for the ratings.


Legend:
* Bugfix
+ New Feature or improvement
- Changed behaviour


Overall
+ Infrastructure for updates moved to vBAddict.net
+ Compatibility with WoT 0.9.0
+ Installation moved to Windows Installer Technology, resulting in smaller and faster patches
+ Upgrade to DevExpress 12.5

Look and Feel
+ Made Look and Feel the same over the whole Application
+ Added some icons to Buttons

Data
+ New Window to browse and export all tank related data to Excel
+ Added Damage Assisted via Radio and Detracking (available only for Battles/Tanks played since Patch 0.8.8, WG did not track that information in previous versions)


Ratings / Efficiency
+ All Ratings are now always visible, no need to select only one
+ Implemented WN8
+ Implemented Table with expected Tank Values for WN8
- WN4 and WN6 were removed, they are outdated and replaced by WN7.
+ Added vBAddict's Battle Rating which includes Damage Assisted via Radio and Detracking. This is based on old Efficiency Formula. See also: http://www.vbaddict.net/wot.php?do=efficiency
+ Added seperate official Color Scale for BR, WN7 and WN8 (9 colors instead of existing 6 for Eff)
